The Gaming Room, our client, required "Draw It or Lose It," a web-based game where teams guess puzzles from stock drawings rendered over 30 seconds in four 1-minute rounds with a 15-second steal phase, needing support for multiple teams/players, unique names, a single game instance, and cross-platform compatibility; I excelled in crafting a clear UML class diagram using OOP principles and recommending Windows with Spring Boot for scalability and real-time functionality. The design document’s UML and requirements analysis guided modular, scalable code development, while I’d revise the cross-platform section to detail browser/mobile testing with tools like BrowserStack for better optimization. I interpreted user needs by mapping functional and non-functional requirements to solutions like Singleton and WebSocket, which is crucial for aligning design with usability and future adaptability. My approach—requirement analysis, UML modeling, and platform evaluation—will guide future projects, enhanced by prototyping and agile feedback loops.
